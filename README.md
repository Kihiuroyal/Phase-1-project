# Phase-1-project
Overview
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

Business Understanding
The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the risk profiles of different aircraft to help the aviation company decide which aircraft to purchase.
We will:
1. Understand the incident and accident data.
2. Identify the highest and lowest risk aircraft.
3. Provide actionable recommendations based on risk scores


Data Understanding and Analysis
Our dataset is sourced from kaggle and is fron the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
