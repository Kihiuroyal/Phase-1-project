# Phase-1-project
Overview

Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

Business Understanding

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the risk profiles of different aircraft to help the aviation company decide which aircraft to purchase.
We will:
1. Understand the incident and accident data.
2. Identify the highest and lowest risk aircraft.
3. Provide actionable recommendations based on risk scores


Data Understanding and Analysis

Our dataset is sourced from kaggle and is fron the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.


THE BOTTOM 10 MODELS BASED ON AVERAGE INJURIES

* The safest model is the Boeing 777 and it is followed by the Howard DGA-15P and Piper PA-18A 150 models.
* Models like Boeing 757-222 and 757-232 are also strong candidates for safe aircraft investments.
* Even with multiple reported events, these aircraft maintain low injury severity.


THE SAFEST MAKES ACCORDING TO AVERAGE TOTAL INJURIES

EIRIAVION OY and HOWARD AIRCRAFT CORP in general are the safest makes.


THE RISKIEST MODELS IN TERMS OF TOTAL INJURIES

* Models like 737, 172, and 737-200 have the highest total injuries.
* These models are best to be avoided even though popularity may have played a part in the statistic.



  
  
  
  Recommendations
* Shortlist low-risk aircraft:  Boeing 777, Howard DGA-15P, Piper PA-18A 150.
* CESSNA is the aircraft make to avoid due to its aircrafts’ huge involvement in accidents/incidents.
* For a more informed decision this data should be combined with maintenance and operational feedback.
